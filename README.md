# Mal-Toolbox

Mal is a toolset in development that provides students and admirers of mathematics a transparent view into the workings
that drive several numerical analysis applications.

According to Wikipedia, "Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to general
symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis."

Devices such as graphing calculators use techniques from numerical analysis when they integrate or find intercepts, but they do
not provide the user with a good look at what is going on behind the scenes.

Mal hopes to fill this void by allowing users to adjust, test, and measure different algorithms. 

The project is built on top of a lightweight graphing utility made in WebGL and JavaScript.
